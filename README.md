# Assignment 3

This is a skeleton project for Assignment 3.

## Getting Started

Commit, push and submit your GitHub repository link (generated by GitHub Classrooms) on Cavnas before the due date.

## Requirements

- Develop using SwiftUI and MVVM pattern.
- It does NOT have to be as complex as the ParksApp. 
- A simple app that reads a few fields should be enough.
